# Elevate-labs--task4
Overview

This project is a simple Java calculator application designed to demonstrate core Java programming concepts such as methods, method overloading, exception handling, pass-by-value behavior, and clean code structure.
Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate method, and the program is structured to be easy to understand, reusable, and testable.

Objectives

The application demonstrates:
Creating a calculator with separate methods for each operation
Method overloading using different parameter types
Reusable utility methods
Effective use of return values
Java pass-by-value behavior
Exception handling for divide-by-zero
Code structure that reduces redundancy
